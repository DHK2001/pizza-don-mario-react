# Pizza Don Mario (React)

This project is a **visual mockup of a pizzeria website** built using **React**.  
It is not a fully functional application, but rather a practice project created to learn the basics of React and compare the experience with building the same type of site using only HTML and CSS (see [DHK2001.github.io]([https://dhk2001.github.io](https://dhk2001.github.io/examples/nav-bar-example/index.html))).

## üìñ About the Project

The goal of this project was to practice **React** and understand how components, JSX, and a structured React app can improve development compared to plain HTML and CSS.

This site simulates the look of a real pizzeria website and includes the following sections:

- **Home** ‚Üí Hero section with featured promotions.  
- **Menu** ‚Üí List of pizzas and other items with prices.  
- **About** ‚Üí Information about the pizzeria.  
- **Contact** ‚Üí Basic contact page layout.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The project is **purely visual**. There is no backend, state management, or dynamic logic implemented. It is intended only as a **front-end practice exercise**.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
